      "* **Best Practices:** \n",
      "    * Backlog Building\n",
      "    * Sprint advancement\n",
      "* **Team Structure:** All team members have a wide range of similar skill sets.\n",
      "* **Team Size:** Smaller teams are preferred to deliver with fewer complexities.\n",
      "* **Time Management:** Short, predetermined timeframes (sprints), typically a week long. \n",
      "* **Automation:** Not a primary focus.\n",
      "* **Documentation:** Working system is prioritized over documentation.\n",
      "* **Tools:** Bugzilla, JIRA, Kanboard, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DevOps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Focus:** DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development and IT operations to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver continuous delivery with high software quality.\n",
      "* **Origin:** Invented in 2007 by John Allspaw and Paul Hammond at Flickr, and the Phoenix Project by Gene Kim.\n",
      "* **Application:**  DevOps is not related to software development. The software used by DevOps is pre-built, dependable, and easy to deploy.\n",
      "* **Approach:** Typically a conclusion of administration related to designing, focused on steady testing and delivery.\n",
      "* **Best Practices:** \n",
      "    * Focus on specialized greatness.\n",
      "    * Collaborate directly with clients and incorporate their feedback.\n",
      "* **Team Structure:** Diverse approach with a \"Divide and Conquer\" philosophy, work is partitioned between development and operations teams. \n",
      "* **Team Size:** \"Bigger is better\", with larger teams to manage larger tasks.\n",
      "* **Time Management:** Prioritizes reliability and long-term plans to minimize business disruptions.\n",
      "* **Automation:**  DevOps is heavily focused on automation. \n",
      "* **Documentation:** Process documentation is crucial.\n",
      "* **Tools:** Puppet, Ansible, AWS, Chef, TeamCity, OpenStack, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Differences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Origin:** Agile is older than DevOps.\n",
      "* **Scope:** Agile focuses on software development, while DevOps encompasses a broader range of IT operations.\n",
      "* **Emphasis:** Agile prioritizes continuous changes, while DevOps emphasizes continuous testing and delivery. \n",
      "* **Team Structure:** Agile teams are more homogeneous, while DevOps teams are more diverse with specialized roles.\n",
      "* **Automation:** DevOps relies heavily on automation, while Agile does not prioritize it. \n",
      "* **Time Management:** Agile focuses on short sprints, while DevOps prioritizes long-term stability and reliability.\n",
